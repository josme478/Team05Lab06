#' @title A package for solving 0/1 Knapsack problem.
#' @description This package contains three functions for solving 0/1 Knapsack problem using a different approach in each function. The functions are \code{brute_force_knapsack()}, \code{knapsack_dynamic()} and \code{greedy_knapsack()}.
#' @details The knapsack problem is a problem of optimization. Given a set of items, each item with a weight and a value, the objective is to fill a knapsack with the subset that offers the best value without exceeding the knapsack weight capacity. More details are given in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem}{Wikipedia.}
